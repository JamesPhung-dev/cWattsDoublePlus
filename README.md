# cWatts++
cWatts++ is a lightweight virtual power meter leveraging the accurate power monitoring of distributed applications using a client-server model. A client back-end runs for each virtual entity transmitting power usage information, estimated using a power model, to the server front-end. At the core of cWatts++ is its application-agnostic power model. To this end, we devise two power models (eventModel and raplModel) that are driven by CPU event counters and the Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) feature of modern Intel CPUs, respectively. While eventModel is more generic and, thus, applicable to a wide range of workloads, raplModel is particularly good for CPU-bound workloads. Our evaluation study, in a real system with the PARSEC benchmark suite and our in-house benchmarks, demonstrates that these power models have an average error of 4.55 % and 1.25 %, respectively.
